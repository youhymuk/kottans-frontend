In this course, I learned about things like this:   
- how to create and delete tags   
- difference between regular merge and fast-forward merge    
- how to resolve merge conflict   
- reverting commit    
- git does keep track of everything for about 30 days before it completely erases anything

I knew only basic commands of CLI, but after this course, I learned many useful commands that will be very useful in the future:

- `more <file>` display the contents of the file
- `cat <file1> <file2>` concatenate files
- `find` locate files
- `man <command>` view manual pages
- `grep <text> <file>` find words in text
- `kill <process-id>` kill process
- `chmod u/g/o + r/w/x <file>` change file permissions
- `finger` show user information
- `ps` show process status
- `df` show free disc space

In the articles about networking, everything was new to me except for request methods and status codes.
