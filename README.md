## <a name='git_basics'>Git Basics</a>

In this course, I learned about things like this:   
- how to create and delete tags   
- difference between regular merge and fast-forward merge    
- how to resolve merge conflict   
- reverting commit    
- git does keep track of everything for about 30 days before it completely erases anything

## <a name='linux_cli'>Linux CLI and Networking</a>

I knew only basic commands of CLI, but after this course, I learned many useful commands that will be very useful in the future:

- `more <file>` display the contents of the file
- `cat <file1> <file2>` concatenate files
- `find` locate files
- `man <command>` view manual pages
- `grep <text> <file>` find words in text
- `kill <process-id>` kill process
- `chmod u/g/o + r/w/x <file>` change file permissions
- `finger` show user information
- `ps` show process status
- `df` show free disc space

In the articles about networking, everything was new to me except for request methods and status codes.

## <a name='git_collab'>GitHub and Collaboration</a>

[GitHub and Collaboration Screenshots](git_collaboration)

Learned about:
- difference between `pull` and `fetch`
- `git shortlog` to groupe each commit by author and title
- `git log --greb=word` to watch all commits related to word
- `git remote rename` to rename the current remote
- `git branch -f master HEAD` to move branch
- `git cherry-pick <Commit1> <Commit2> <...>` copy commits to HEAD
- `git branch -u origin/master branchName` the current branch will track a remote branch


[Here](https://learngitbranching.js.org) I also figured out in more detail how to work with `push`, `fetch` and `pull` commands.

## <a name='html_css'>Intro to HTML & CSS</a>

[Intro to HTML & CSS Screenshots](html_css_intro)

I did not learn anything new in this section, but I  have repeated the material :smiley:

## <a name='responsive'>Intro to HTML & CSS</a>

[Responsive Web Design](responsive_web_design)

As in the previous step, there was nothing new for me :sunglasses:

## <a name='html_css_task'>HTML & CSS Practice</a>

It wasn't very hard, but good practice for me.
